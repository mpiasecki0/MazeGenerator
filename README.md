# Maze Generator
A JavaScript / HTML5 application that visualizes procedural generation.

## What this Application does

This application takes some user input via HTML5 to build a customized grid and then traverses that grid to build a maze out of it.
All of this is happening in real time and you can visually follow how the maze is built using the "Depth-first search algorithm". The 
visualization part helps to understand how the algorithm works.

There is a really good explanation on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) which I myself used to build 
this program. It explains each step which the algorithm takes to generate a maze. I highly recommend you to read through it if you are 
interested in procedural generation and you want to learn more about it.

### Prerequisites

This Application is using plain javascript and HTML5 so you should be able to run it if you have a browser that can interpret JavaScript.
I recommend using Google Chrome for good performance and simplicity.
